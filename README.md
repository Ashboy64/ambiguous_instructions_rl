# Grounded Language Learning with Ambiguous Instructions

This project investigates the capability of RL algorithms to learn to recognize ambiguous instructions and ask for help if ambiguity is detected. All experiments are based on the BabyAI Platform (https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai).

## Usage
- Install BabyAI as described at https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai
- `ambiguity.py` contains functions to make BabyAI instructions ambiguous
